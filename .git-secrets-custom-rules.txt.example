# Example Custom Git Secrets Rules for Your Repository
#
# This is an example file showing how to add custom rules to your repository.
# Copy this file to your repository and rename it (e.g., .git-secrets-custom-rules.txt)
# Then reference it in your .pre-commit-config.yaml:
#
#   - repo: https://github.com/your-org/nhsd-git-secrets-precommit
#     rev: v1.0.0
#     hooks:
#       - id: nhsd-git-secrets
#         args: ['--custom-rules-file', '.git-secrets-custom-rules.txt']
#
# Add your regex patterns below (one per line).
# These patterns will be checked IN ADDITION to the default NHSD rules.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file should contain PATTERNS to detect secrets, not actual secrets!
# It's safe to commit this file to your repository.

# Example 1: Company-specific API key format
# mycompany_api_[0-9a-zA-Z]{40}

# Example 2: Internal authentication tokens
# AUTH_TOKEN\s*[:=]\s*["']?[0-9a-zA-Z_-]{32,}["']?

# Example 3: Database connection strings with passwords
# (mysql|postgresql|mongodb)://[^:]+:[^@]+@

# Example 4: Environment variables with "secret" or "key" in the name
# (SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD|CREDENTIALS)\s*[:=]\s*["'].+["']

# Example 5: Project-specific secret patterns
# PROJECT_SECRET_[A-Z_]+\s*=\s*.+

# Example 6: Internal service URLs with credentials
# https://[^:]+:[^@]+@internal-service\.company\.com

# Example 7: Specific file types that should never contain secrets
# If you need to block certain patterns in specific files, combine with
# pre-commit's 'files' option in .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Add your custom patterns below:
